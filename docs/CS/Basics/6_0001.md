## Lecture 5 Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability and Cloning

### Tuples ()

Tuples hold collection of data.

#### Characteristics

- Tuples are immutable

- conveniently used to swap varoable values

  ```python
  (x,y) = (y,x)
  ```

- used to **return more than one value from a function**

  ```python
  def quotient_and_remainder(x,y)
  	quotient = x // y
      remainder = x % y
      return (quotient,remainder)
  
  (quot,rem) = quotient_and_remainder(4,5)
  ```

### Lists []

#### Characteristics

- Lists are mutable objects.

- Often used to convert list to strings and vice versa for better operation.

  <img src="https://gitee.com/violets/typora--images/raw/main/imgs/202112021515913.png" alt="image-20211202151532871" style="zoom:67%;" />

- If you don't want side effects of list, you should clone it.

  *<u>**Side effect** means if you alter a  list, all variables point to this list changed their value.</u>*

- Don't modify a list's length when you iterate it. *Solution: Clone it first (b = a[:]) *

#### Methods for lists

Assume L is a list.

1. L.append()

2. L.extend()

3. L.pop()

   *<u>remove element at the end of list. **This function's return value gonna to be the element removed.**</u>*

4. L.remove(element)

   *<u>remove certain element from list L, but only remove the very first occurance of it.</u>*

5. L.split(element)

   <img src="https://gitee.com/violets/typora--images/raw/main/imgs/202112021509117.png" alt="image-20211202150943053" style="zoom: 50%;" />

6. sort() AND sorted()

   *sorted(L)* :arrow_right: *returns sorted list, doesn't mutate L*

   *L.sort() â€‹*:arrow_right: *mutates a sorted L*

   *L.reverse()* :arrow_right: *mutates a reversed L*

## Lecture 6 Recursion and Dictionaries

### Recursion :arrow_forward: *Devide and conquer*

Semantically, recursion means <u>a function call itself in its definition.</u>

To avoid infinite recursion, you should ensure there's at least one or more base cases that are easy to solve.

for and while loop have  a state variable tells you exactly how your loop going.

Typecally, recursion contains two steps:

1. Recurise step:

   think how to reduce problem to a **simpler/smaller version** of the same problem.

2. Base case:

   keep resucing problem until reach a simple case that can be **solved directly** 

#### Characteristics

1. More intuitive to understand than iterative loop (for, while).
2. more efficient to write

```python
# Use Recursion to solve Hannoi Tower Problem
def Hannoi_Tower(n,fr,to,spare):
    if n == 1:
        print("Move from", fr, "to", to)
    else:
        Hannoi_Tower(n-1, fr, spare, to)
        Hannoi_Tower(1, fr, to, spare)
        Hannoi_Tower(n-1, spare, to, fr)

Hannoi_Tower(4, "T1", "T2", "T3")
```

Calculate fibonacci number *<u>This recursion has more than one base case.</u>*

```python
def Fibonacci(n):
    """
    Assume n is int >= 0
    Returns fibonacci of n
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2)


print(Fibonacci(3))
print(Fibonacci(4))
print(Fibonacci(5))
```

### Dictionary {}

#### Characteristics

1. keys need to be unique and immutable

   *<u>Keys' data type can only be ints, floats, strings, tuples, booleans.</u>*

2. Can directly mutate dictionary; makes it easier to iterate.

3. Dictionaries are not only valuable for store away data, but also valuable on procedure calls when intermediate values are not going to change.

   *Fibonacci with a dictionary can be very efficient.*

   ```python
   #####################################
   # EXAMPLE: comparing fibonacci using memoization
   #####################################
   
   
   def fib(n):
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       elif n == 2:
           return 2
       else:
           return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
   
   
   def fib_efficient(n, d):
       if n in d:
           return d[n]
       else:
           ans = fib_efficient(n-1, d)+fib_efficient(n-2, d)
           d[n] = ans
           return ans
           
   d = {1:1, 2:2}
   
   argToUse = 34
   #print("")
   #print('using fib')
   #print(fib(argToUse))
   #print("")
   #print('using fib_efficient')
   #print(fib_efficient(argToUse, d))
   
   ```

   

#### Methods

Assume ***<u>grades</u>*** is  a dictionary.

- grades.keys()

  returns dictionary keys in arbitary order.

- grades.values()

## Lecture 7 Testing, debugging, exceptions and assertions

### Testing

1. Unit testing
   - validate each piece of program
   - testing each function separately
2. Regression testing
   - add test for bugs as you find them
   - catch reintroduced errors that were previously fixed
3. Integration testing
   - does overall program work?
   - tend to rush to do this

#### Testing approaches

1. random testing (Not Recommend)
2. Black box testing
3. Glass box testing

### Exceptions and assertions

Exceptions and assertions make it easier to locate a source of bug.

- Exceptions help you when you get wrong input. 

- Assertions make you know where the program get unwanted values and terminate you program immediately.

```python
######################################
# EXAMPLE: Raising your own exceptions
######################################
def get_ratios(L1, L2):
    """ Assumes: L1 and L2 are lists of equal length of numbers
        Returns: a list containing L1[i]/L2[i] """
    ratios = []
    for index in range(len(L1)):
        try:
            ratios.append(L1[index]/L2[index])
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            ratios.append(float('nan')) #nan = Not a Number
        except:
            raise ValueError('get_ratios called with bad arg')
        else:
            print("success")
        finally:
            print("executed no matter what!")
    return ratios
    
print(get_ratios([1, 4], [2, 4]))

```

```python
# avg function: version with assert
def avg(grades):
    assert len(grades) != 0, 'warning: no grades data'
    return sum(grades)/len(grades)

    
test_grades = [[['peter', 'parker'], [80.0, 70.0, 85.0]], 
              [['bruce', 'wayne'], [100.0, 80.0, 74.0]],
              [['captain', 'america'], [80.0, 70.0, 96.0]],
              [['deadpool'], []]]

print(get_stats(test_grades))

```

## Lecture 8  Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming makes you able to bundle this data  and bundle some internal representation and some ways to interact with a program into these packages, and with packages, you can create objects, and all objects are going to behave exact the same way (same internal representation and same way that you can interact with them).

**Object**: a instance of your class that has the type, the name of your class.

**Attributes**: data and procedures that "belong" to the class.

**Method**: *<u>(procedural attributes)</u>* consider it as a function that only works with this particular type of object.

```python
class Coordinate(object):
    # define attributes here
    def __init__(self, x, y)
    	"""
    	Generally you define data attributes inside this __init__
    	"""
    	self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def __str__(self):
        """
        Python calls __str__ method when used with print on your class object
        """
        return "<"+str(self.x)+", "+str(self.y)+">"
    
# Coordinate is a subclass of object, inherits all its attributes
# object is a superclass of Coordinate
c = Coordinate(3, 4)
print(isinstance(c, Coordinate))
```

***

**\_\_init\_\_**  is a special method tells Python when you first create an object of this type, call this method.

**\_\_str\_\_** has to return a string

**self** represents a particular instance of the class. (For methods that belong to the class, the first parameter is always going to be self (by convention).)

***

### Advantages

1. Bundle data into packages
2. devide-and-conquer development
3. classes make it easier to reuse code
4. Allows us to add layers of abstraction to our code

  ## Lecture 9 Classes and Inheritance

### Getters and Setters

Getters and Setters can prevent bugs from come into play latter on someone decides to change implementation.

**getters**: return  the values of any of the data attributes

**setters**: going to set the data attributes to whatever is passed in

:warning: *<u>Getters and setters should be used outside of class to access data attributes.</u>* (Reason: Information hiding)

```python
class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age
        self.name = None
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age
    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
    def set_age(self, newage):
        self.age = newage
    def set_name(self, newname=""):
        self.name = newname
    def __str__(self):
        return "animal:"+str(self.name)+":"+str(self.age)
        
print("\n---- animal tests ----")
a = Animal(3)
# Two ways to access data attributes
a.age
a.get_age()
# Better to use getters and setters to access data attributes
```

### Default Arguments

Default arguments are passed into functions/methods.

### Inheritance

- If subclass doesn't have \_\_init\_\_, it'll use its superclass's \_\_init\_\_. 

  This characteristic remains true for any other methods.

- Class variables' value gonna shared between all of the instances in the class. While instance variables can have different values for each instance.

  You should access your class variables use class name. `self.rid = Rabbit.tag` *Rabbit is a class name, Rabbit.tag is a class variable.*

## Lecture 10 Understanding Programming Efficiency

Program efficiency  refers both to space and time, but primarily to time.

- Order of growth (*the big O notation*)

Two ways to understand program efficiency

- How can you <u>reason about(predict)</u> the time a program takes to solve a particular size problem
- How can we relate choices in algorithm design to the time efficiency of resulting algorithm

Choices of designing algorithms

- (choice of implementation) Different ways to achieve an operation

  *<u>**e.g.** Using for loop or while loop</u>*

- (choice of algorithm) Choose different algorithms

  *<u>**e.g.** Do it recursively or iterally</u>*

### How to evaluate efficiency *<u>(Three ways)</u>*

What we want to evaluate here is the algorithm, not the machine or implementations. And especially want to understand how does it scale? *<u>if you change size of  the algorithm, in which way it will affect algorithm efficiency.</u>*

#### 1. Set a timer and time your algorithm

<u>*Timer evaluate time between different algorithms, but it varies on a lot of  other factors.*</u>

1. varies between implementations

2. varies between computers

3. not predictable based on small inputs

   *<u>Because for  really large sized problems will have issues like get things out of memory and bring them back in to the computer</u>*

#### 2. Count the operations

1. count depends on algorithm :heavy_check_mark:
2. count depends  on implementations :heavy_multiplication_x:
3. count independent of computers :heavy_check_mark:
4. no clear definition of which operations to count :heavy_multiplication_x:
5. count varies for different inputs and can come up with a relationship between inputs and the count :heavy_check_mark:



#### 3. Order of growth $O ()$

<img src="https://gitee.com/violets/typora--images/raw/main/imgs/202112131010382.png" alt="image-20211210161456780" style="zoom: 25%;" />

Going to look for as tight as possible an upper bound of growth as a function of the size of input in the worst case.

Focus on what happens when the size of the problem gets arbitrarily large. And express size of efficiency in terms of size of input. We want to know what the relationship between if you increase the size of input and the runtime after you do that.

Usually, when we talk about complexity, we gonna focus on the worst case behavior. Change in average speed doesn't mean it change the order of growth of one algorithm.

*<u>most appropriate way of assessing the impact of choices of algorithm in solving a problem; and in measuring the inherent difficulty in solving a problem.</u>*

**Worst case asymptotic complexity**

- ignore additive constants

- ignore multiplicative constants

**Law of Addition for $O()$:**

Used with sequential statements
$$
O(f(n)) + O(g(n)) = O(f(n)+g(n))
$$
**Law of  for $O()$:**

Used with nested statements/loops:
$$
O(f(n)) * O(g(n)) = O(f(n)*g(n))
$$
Nested loops typically(not always) have that kind of behavior. (*<u>Nested loop might be implicit. e.g. `ele in Alist`</u>*)

**Some basic order of growth**

1. $O(1)$ independent of input problem's size

2. $O(n)$ problem reduces linearly each time. (e.g. loop)

3. $O(log(n))$ problem divides it size each time (e.g. bisection)

4. $O(n\space log(n))$ (e.g. merge sort algorithm)

5. $O(n^C)$ [Polynomial Complexity] nested loops or recursive function calls

6. $O(C ^ n)$ [Exponential Complexity] 

   Two situations for exponential complexity (Use recurrence relation to calculate complexity):

   1. recursive functions where more than one recursive call for each size of problem. *<u>e.g. Hanoi Tower</u>*

   2. Can also be buried inside of how you growth the size of the problem. *<u> Loop grows in size each time around.</u>*

      ```python
      def genSubsets(L):
          if len(L) == 0:
              return [[]] #list of empty list
          smaller = genSubsets(L[:-1]) # all subsets without last element
          extra = L[-1:] # create a list of just last element
          new = []
          for small in smaller:
              new.append(small+extra)  # for all smaller solutions, add one with last element
          return smaller+new  # combine those with last element and those without
      ```

      *The for loop size (i.e. `len(smaller)`) going to be growing exponentially.  If  `len(L) = n` the loop size gonna to be $2^{n-1}$ in this case.* 

## Lecture 11 Searching and Sorting

*Exhaustive Enumeration*

Searching is to find items in a collection. That collection can be either implicit *<u>(e. g. find square roots, the collection is all the numbers between some point and some other point )</u>* or explicit.

### Sorting Algorithms

1. Monkey/Bogo sort [Complexity: $O(n^n)$]

   Randomly permute elements in a collection, check if the sequence of elements is sorted.

2. Bubble sort [Complexity: $O(n^2)$]

   Compare elements pairwise, move the smaller on to the first of these two, continue until no more swap can be done.

   ```python
   def bubble_sort(L):
       swap = False
       while not swap:
           print('bubble sort: ' + str(L))
           swap = True
           for j in range(1, len(L)):
               if L[j-1] > L[j]:
                   swap = False
                   temp = L[j]
                   L[j] = L[j-1]
                   L[j-1] = temp
   
   testList = [1,3,5,7,2,6,25,18,13]
   
   print('')
   print(bubble_sort(testList))
   print(testList)
   
   ```

3. Selection sort [Complexity: $O(n^2)$]

   Find the smallest element, put it in front.

   ```python
   def selection_sort(L):
       suffixSt = 0
       while suffixSt != len(L):
           print('selection sort: ' + str(L))
           for i in range(suffixSt, len(L)):
               if L[i] < L[suffixSt]:
                   L[suffixSt], L[i] = L[i], L[suffixSt]
           suffixSt += 1
   
   testList = [1,3,5,7,2,6,25,18,13]
          
   print('')
   print(selection_sort(testList))
   print(testList)
   
   ```

4. Merge sort

   Divide list into two sublists (continue divide until length of these sublists at most 2), sort them, then compare the first element of each, take the smaller one add to result. Keep doing that until one of  the list is empty and copy the reminder of the other list.

   <img src="C:%5CUsers%5CLENOVO%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5Cimage-20211212113031713.png" alt="image-20211212113031713" style="zoom: 50%;" />

   ```python
   def merge(left, right):
       result = []
       i,j = 0,0
       while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
           if left[i] < right[j]:
               result.append(left[i])
               i += 1
           else:
               result.append(right[j])

   To compute the total cost represented by the recurrence of merge sort, we simply add up the costs of all the levels. *<u>Where constant $c$ represents the time required to solve problems of size 1 as well as the time per array element of the divide and combine steps.</u>* The recursion tree has $log{n} +1$ levels, each costing $cn$, for a total cost of $cn(log{n}+1)=cnlog{n}+cn$. Ignoring the low-order term and the constant c gives the desired result of $O (nlog{n})$.
